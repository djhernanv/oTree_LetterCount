<div class="instructions well well-lg">
    <p>
        You have been randomly allocated into a group of five participants: A, B, C, D and E.
        You are participant <strong>{{Label}}</strong>. <br>
	      The experiment is anonymous. You will not be told who the other participants are and they will not be informed about your identity.</p>
    <p>
        There will be <strong>six rounds</strong> of 4 minutes. You and the other group members will be performing the same task as in part 1.</p>
    <p>
        In the <strong>first round all participants</strong> will use the <strong><em>basic techonology</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>
        Remember that using the <em>basic technology</em> means that the length of sequences increases by four characters
        and using the <em>advanced technology</em> means that the length of sequences increases by two characters.</p>
    <p>
        In all the <strong>following rounds</strong>, exactly <strong>two out of the five group members</strong> will use
	      the <strong><em>advanced technology</em></strong>. <br>
	      Whether you get the <em>advanced technology</em> in the next round, depends on the number of sequences you and the other group members
	      solved in the previous round. The more strings you solve, the higher are your chances! <br>
	      Earnings from the <em>switch mode</em> do <u>not</u> affect your chances of getting the <em>advanced technology</em>.</p>
    <p>
        On the next screen, you will see an illustrative example of how the <em>advanced technology</em> is allocated.</p>
